1
00:00:00,028 --> 00:00:03,033
welcome to week for congratulations on
making at this point

2
00:00:03,033 --> 00:00:06,502
this week we're gonna talk about
performance the performance of computer

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,820
systems driven by a variety of factors

4
00:00:08,082 --> 00:00:11,148
including the performance of the
underlying hardware CPU the desk in the

5
00:00:12,048 --> 00:00:12,096
memory

6
00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:15,108
once you've chosen hardware
configuration it's gonna be your

7
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:19,797
algorithm that the term performance and
for database backup application

8
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:23,460
it can be the our rhythms they're used
to satisfy your queries

9
00:00:23,046 --> 00:00:26,935
there are two ways you can impact the
latency and throughput

10
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:31,230
database queries one is at indexes to
collections

11
00:00:31,023 --> 00:00:34,032
and two is to distribute the load across
multiple servers

12
00:00:35,013 --> 00:00:38,051
using shorting this week we're gonna
talk about performance

13
00:00:38,051 --> 00:00:42,170
but to make matter to look more
interesting in manga to be three point

14
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:45,730
I'll we introduce portable storage
engines

15
00:00:45,073 --> 00:00:49,092
storage engine is the software the
controls how the data is stored

16
00:00:49,092 --> 00:00:54,001
on desk also to talk about hugs twice
the storage engine impact performance

17
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:57,829
now performance is normally

18
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:00,910
the domain a database administrators but
good developers

19
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:03,770
understand performance and write their
applications with performance in mind

20
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:07,660
and the bug performed at problems with
their applications

21
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:09,110
let's get started
