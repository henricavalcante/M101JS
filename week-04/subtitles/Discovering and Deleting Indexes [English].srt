1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:03,080
okay knowing how to create indexes on a
collection how would you discover what

2
00:00:03,008 --> 00:00:04,084
indexes are already on the collection

3
00:00:05,056 --> 00:00:08,075
well we can do that with the get indexes
command

4
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:11,794
so I'm gonna start them on a shell again
in once again I'm any use the

5
00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:15,910
school database and then I'm going to
call

6
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:18,290
DB dot students got get indexes

7
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:22,320
students the name the collection and as
you remember the last lesson we just

8
00:00:22,032 --> 00:00:23,056
added an index to it

9
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:27,685
first to ninety recall getting Nexus if
we do that we get back

10
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:31,271
this result which is a document actually
to the rave to documents

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,160
and the first one tell you that there is
an

12
00:00:35,016 --> 00:00:39,051
index underscore I D now this index
exist in all collections and you can't

13
00:00:39,051 --> 00:00:43,070
delete there's also an index on student
underscored a

14
00:00:43,007 --> 00:00:46,016
and that index we just created and we
wanted to you

15
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:50,031
get rid of that index we would call DB

16
00:00:50,085 --> 00:00:53,544
dot Stevens dot drop in X and

17
00:00:54,309 --> 00:00:57,327
provide this exact same signature as we
created

18
00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:01,840
so here are calling drop in tax and
we're giving the same signature students

19
00:01:01,084 --> 00:01:03,143
cried econ one that we gave we created
the index

20
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:08,061
if we do that we should be able to drop
and there you go

21
00:01:08,061 --> 00:01:11,093
I'm indexes was too and now it's one and

22
00:01:11,093 --> 00:01:14,167
if we get index is again will see that
in fact

23
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:18,070
there is only one index perfect alright

24
00:01:18,097 --> 00:01:21,118
one last point I want to make is that
this call get indexes

25
00:01:22,018 --> 00:01:26,060
is a call that you use in Mongo DB 3.0

26
00:01:26,006 --> 00:01:30,095
and will work on both wired tiger and
I'm at b1

27
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:33,728
and an earlier version to the database
you could

28
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,140
look at a special collection system the
indexes

29
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:40,703
to see you indexes existed that does not
work

30
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:45,110
in wire tiger and so that preferred way
to figure out what next on a collection

31
00:01:45,011 --> 00:01:48,086
is to do this to call DB that students
that it can indexes and again

32
00:01:48,086 --> 00:01:50,113
is a change in Mongo DB 3.0
